# Assignment 44

For this assignment you will setup a Java project with Maven. Maven will be used to manage dependencies and compile the code (and create a JAR).

## Instructions

1. Create a new project on Replit (or whatever IDE you're using). Then execute the Maven goal in the Shell to create a Maven project (make sure to give your app a name and use your own name instead of "mycompany" for the package).

2. Then make the updates to the POM (my file is included here in the repo).

**Note: my POM uses the default values for the package and project name, so adjust those as needed.**

3. Add the Gson dependency to the POM.

4. Download the Java files in this repo and add them to the project.

5. Clean and package the project.

6. Run the created JAR.

## Submission

Download the project as a zip file and submit on Canvas.
