# Assignment 44

For this assignment you will setup a Java project with Maven. Maven will be used to manage dependencies, compile the code, and package the code into a JAR.

## Instructions

1. Create a new project on Replit (or whatever IDE you're using) and delete any starter Java files. 

2. Execute the Maven goal in the Shell to create a Maven project (make sure to use your own name instead of "mycompany" for the package).

3. Make the updates to the POM (my file is included here in the repo).

**Note: my POM uses the default values for the package and project names, so adjust those to match your values.**

4. Add the Gson dependency to the POM (code to add to the POM can be found at the [Maven Repository website](https://mvnrepository.com/)).

5. Download the Java files in this repo and add them to the project. Note: `AppTest.java` replaces the `AppTest.java` file in the test/ directory.

6. Execute the appropriate commands in the Shell to clean and package the project.

7. Run the created JAR in the Shell. The program should run and print the output without any errors.

## Submission

Download the project as a zip file and submit on Canvas.
