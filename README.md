# Assignment 44

For this assignment you will setup a Java project with Maven. Maven will be used to manage dependencies, compile the code, and package the code into a JAR.

## Instructions

1. Create a new project on Replit (or whatever IDE you're using) and delete the `Main.java` file.. 

2. Execute the Maven goal in the Shell to create a Maven project (make sure to use your own name instead of "mycompany" for the package).

3. Make the updates to the POM (my file is included here in the repo).

**Note: my POM uses the default values for the package and project name, so adjust those as needed.**

4. Add the Gson dependency to the POM.

5. Download the Java files in this repo and add them to the project. Note: `AppTest.java` replaces the `AppTest.java` file in the test/ directory.

6. Clean and package the project.

7. Run the created JAR.

## Submission

Download the project as a zip file and submit on Canvas.
